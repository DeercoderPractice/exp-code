\section{Nonhamiltonian Odd Bipartite Graphs (20 points)}
Question: Prove that if $G$ is an undirected bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices, then $G$ is nonhamiltonian.


\section{Enumerating Vertices (20 points)}
Question: Show that if HAM-CYCLE $\in{P}$, then the problem of listing the vertices of a hamiltonian cycle, in order, is polynomial-time solvable.

\section{Hamiltonian Path (10 points)}
Questioin: A \textbf{hamiltonian path} in a graph is a simple path that visits every vertex exactly once. Show that the language HAM-PATH=\{$<G,u,v>$ : there is a hamiltonian path from $u$ to $v$ in graph $G$\} belongs to NP.



\section{Hamiltonian Path in DAG (10 points)}
Question: Show that the hamiltonian-path problem from Exercise 34.2-6 can be solved in polynomial time on directed acyclic graphs. Give an efficient algorithm for the problem.



\section{DNF\-SAT$\in{P}$(20 points)}
Question: Show that the problem of determining the satisfiability of boolean formulas in disjunctive normal form is polynomial-time solvable.


\section{Finding SAT Assignments (20 points)}
Question: Suppose that someone gives you a polynomial-time algorithm to decide formula satisfiability. Describe how to use this algorithm to find satisfying assignments in polynomial time.


\section{Longest Simple Cycle (20 points)}
Question: The \textbf{longest-simple-cycle problem} is the problem of determining a simple cycle (no repeated vertices) of maximum length in a graph. Formulate a related decision problem, and show that the decision problem is NP-complete.
