README
=====

1. first write the source code

2. write the basic CMakeLists.txt file, which includes:
		+) mininum version required

		+) project name and information

		+) target rules, includes src, target name...





How it works
======

1. Using cmakeLists.txt to generate Makefiles automatically

2. using make and generated Makefile to make.




Append
======

cmake -i

choose the right value of our self-defined MACRO(ON/OFF)

then rebuild and remake to generate the executable program.

NOTE: the source code must include config.h files, we must add the config.h files to set its initial value.
